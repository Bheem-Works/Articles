                        So, I didn't go to college on this day and the day was quite good. Well, I did some other stuff and some coding, and the day was pretty fine. I enjoyed it. The most challenging part of this day was that I took a fast (to not eat food for a wish), and yes, I successfully completed it.
                        There is a reason for doing that because I think I really needed to, as I have some hopes. I want those hopes to come true. But let's see what happens. I struggled a lot with my hunger, but I did it, and I am happy about it. The day was pretty fine.
                    </p>
                    <h1>And yeah, that's the end of July 15!</h1>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>It's about July 16</h1>
                    <p>
                        So, this morning was quite rushed, but it was fine because I had prepared everything before. I went to college and the day was pretty fine. I am kind of scared about the English stuff, but there was no special event. But yes, there are some things I have to talk about today.

                    <p>
                        My personal life: I think Mrs. Vim is always hiding something from me, and she is scared that if I say something wrong, I might get in trouble or her heart will break. That's it. There is nothing special about it. I don't like playing hide and seek in relationships. She just started to hurt me. Listening to things directly can make things clear, but hearing them from someone else almost broke my heart at that time. I am not sure about it, but I think she is hiding something from me, and I don't like it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have talked to her about it. There are four things we must continue and protect in a relationship: trust, honesty, loyalty, and priority. These four things are essential and necessary for love. Sometimes I think she is not doing that. She is avoiding things like that. There can be a couple of issues in relationships, but it is okay. If two people can solve those issues by helping each other, then it is fine. But if only one person is trying, it's not enough. I also told her that I might take revenge for what she did to me, and she might be shocked or maybe get the wrong idea. But I know I had to say that. I even made a promise to my mom, so I have to keep it.

                <strong>Event*</strong>
                <br />
                So, today we got the home party because it is the last day of the month and it was quite fun. We had to do the home part and it was enjoyable. I am happy about it, and the day was pretty fine. I have not eaten food and I have kept my promise, and yes, that's it.
                Life will make you feel sad, sometimes so sad it feels like you are living in hell. But you have to be strong and you have to be happy. Life is not easy, but it is not hard either. I don't know if in the future I will be the same person I am right now. It depends on me, but if things keep going like this, then it is hard for me to think about it.
