            and the coding stuff and the day was pretty fine i enojy it. And the most challenging part of this day
            was this i have taken a barta(to do not eat a food for a wish) and yeh i sucesffully completed it.
            well, there is a reason for do that coz i think i really need to do that coz i have some hopes. And i want 
            that hope will come tru. But let's see what happened and that's it. i struggle so much about my hunger
            but i did it. And i am happy about it. And the day was pretty fine
