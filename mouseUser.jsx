        Title: 🖱️ Mouse Users Are Real Noobs – Go Full Keyboard or Go Home 😤

I proudly call myself a skilled and pro-level guy. I hate using the mouse — and honestly, I don’t even want to. That’s why I use Vimium, which lets you control almost everything on a website using just your keyboard. No clicking required.

I also can’t stand slow things. That’s why I ditched the mouse, ditched Windows, and even VS Code. I switched to NeoVim — with all the Vim extensions — because Vim is built for speed. It's fast like me. Or you could say it's trash like me. 😂

But real talk — Vim is hard to master at first, but once you get used to it, it becomes super easy. I’m proof: I sleep 6 hours a day and spend the rest of my nights grinding and posting stuff. What else is there to do, honestly?

Now, let me roast the mouse addicts for a second. I call them noobs. Straight-up noobs. You're literally a noob if you're clicking around all day.

Throw your PC or laptop out the window! (Okay, I'm just kidding… or am I?)

Yeah, I used to use the mouse a lot too when I started. But over time, I trained myself to use keyboard shortcuts for almost everything — even on Windows. Whenever I needed one, I just Googled it or checked Grok, and I slowly built the habit.

Most people only know Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V. That’s it. That’s your whole shortcut game? 😂
NOOB ALERT.

It honestly feels so satisfying calling out people who use the mouse all the time — especially devs. Y’all out here clicking buttons instead of learning the keyboard like a pro. Smh.

If anyone wants shortcut guides, let me know. I’m free — just like Vimium and NeoVim. They’re open-source, they’re powerful, and yeah, they’re a little complicated at first. But once you get past that? You're unstoppable.

Mouse users… how you feeling right now? 😏
I’ve even got pictures to back up my setup — just flexing a little.

And yeah — try out NeoVim, the fastest code editor ever made. I bet you won’t. You probably don’t even know what a semicolon does, right? 😂

Anyway, don’t take this too seriously. This is just a fun roast for my Reddit post and some articles I’m writing. I like to joke around and call out mouse users — especially coders. It’s all love though.

But seriously — let’s be real: Your life is like a while (false) loop — constantly throwing errors and stuck in an endless cycle… all because you won’t ditch the mouse. Maybe this post will flip your condition to true, and you'll finally escape the mouse life.

Again — all jokes. If you're still a heavy mouse user, I get it. I feel your pain. No hard feelings. 😅

This is just for fun, and maybe to give you a little push to try something new. Level up. Be cooler. Be faster.

Oh — and to the legends out there who use the mouse just to pause a YouTube video... Massive respect. 👏👏👏
You’re truly on another level.

Anyway, that’s it. Time to log off.
Don’t forget to check out Vimium and NeoVim.
You can still use your mouse if that makes you happy — but hey, just know you’re a noob in my book. 😎

Bye. That’s a wrap. See ya. Sayonara.
