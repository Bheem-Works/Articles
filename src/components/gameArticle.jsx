        <p>Is making game, Is Different from making the online website? </p>
        <p>I think i am really and stupid person who is doing nothings. Just feels laziness. I don't have focus on what i am making. 
        and i have never make game and the thing's that i have done with my self. i was relly on the toutorial youtubes videos and i just got stuck 
        and what ever youtubes teach me i just did that. I just need to build something's what'st comes in my mind small thing's but i have to 
        build that thing's with myself. No other's youtubes toturials ai help. Just me who is going to bild. And i want to be confident about it. 
        well making the games and doing the all stuff projects. Will that help me to become a good programmer or coder? and can i be able to solve the
      leetcode problems. Like if it is then i am going to tyr and i will make stuff with my own self. </p>
