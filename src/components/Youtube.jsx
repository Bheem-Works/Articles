        <p><strong>Why</strong> sign out from the youtube helps you to be more productive and maintain you focus. It is like you are getting away from the distraction. Let me share how it works <br /> When you are in work or in the moment when you are learning and willing to watch something's for some purpose. Like as reading and watching some toutorials thign's. So when you open your youtube. You get distracted from it. Do you know why? coz you are logged in. It shows what you like most and you will not get at that moment what you are willing to do and what you are about to. You don't even search for it.   </p>
        <p>People get easily distracted from the unwanted youtube content. As a personall experince i am saying.
          when i about to learn something's in the youtube or watch the toutorials. I got distracted by the other's videos. <br />
          to escape from that moment.  I signout from youtube. The advantage of the sign out. You will not get any videos and you will not get distracted yoiu search what you want to see. 
          And stick with that thing's. And you can maintian your focus and watch that video straight and get the hell out from the youtube. 
          You may not think's it will be that much helpful.
