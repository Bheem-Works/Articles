        <p>This is a special day in July.</p>
        <p>
          Let's start with today. The weather was beautiful and sunny, and overall, the day went really well. I enjoyed it a lot.<br />
          <b>Today was a good day.</b> <strong>When I speak in English, I feel confident, and I don't get into as many arguments (jhagda/quarrel).</strong> That's a good thing. I feel like I don't care about unimportant things, and I'm a <b>chill person</b>.
          Anyway, that's it for today. I'll write more in the event section.<br />
          <strong>The account books were also not available in the shop today.</strong>
        </p>

        <div className="event">
          <h1>Event</h1>
          <p>
            Today, I talked a lot about big things, improvements, C programming, and much more. Speaking with someone who gives hope and shares knowledge about what you want to hear is really valuable. I'm quite happy to have a mentor like that from the US, and there are other people who have helped a lot too.<br />
            I also have to complete 100 lines of code today and do my best on my English homework.<br />
            <b>And I have to do the 100 code today.</b><br />
            <i>Jane, see ya!</i>
